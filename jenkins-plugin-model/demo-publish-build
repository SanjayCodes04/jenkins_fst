# Demo 2

## Publish

Build Docker image and publish to Docker Hub; search for `Docker Hub` in [plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/).

- main "Docker" most popular
- but lots of dependencies and lots of features I don't need
- try CloudBees Docker Build & Publish

Back to Jenkins - _Manage Jenkins_ ... _Manage Plugins_

- from `Available` tab
- install CloudBees Docker Build & Publish

In `pi` job, add _build and publish_ step

- repo: `your docker hub repo`
- registry credentials - add new username/password creds
- use Docker Hub username and [authentication token](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security)
- advanced - Dockerfile path 

Build now - FAILS (3yr old plugin)

- add build environment, hub creds:
  - `DOCKER_HUB_USER`
  - `DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD`
- add build step, before build & push

```
docker login -u $DOCKER_HUB_USER -p $DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD
```
